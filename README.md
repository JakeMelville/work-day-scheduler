# Work-Day Scheduler

## Application

The Work-Day Scheduler is designed to create a nice layout for the day that updates in real time. The current hour will be displayed in red, past hours displayed in grey, and future hours displayed in green. The scheduler is broken down by the hour- begining at 9am and concluding at 5pm. Each hour has a textbox where the user can input information. All information is saved in local storage, so when the page is refreshed the data will stay.


## Technologies Used

I used HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for this application. In addtion I also used bootstrap to help style the page and J Query to access elements from the HTML.

## Problems Faced

Everything in my code works- however I believe if I included a couple loops my code would be more concise. 

## How to Use

Input information into the textbox and clock the save button. All information will be saved in local storage.
